# Disaster-relief-routing-optimization
Constraint-based optimization system for disaster relief helicopter routing, maximizing aid delivery under capacity, distance, and cost constraints using heuristic planning techniques.

An optimization and search-based planning system that allocates disaster relief resources using a fleet of helicopters under real-world constraints such as weight limits, travel range, operational cost, and diminishing returns. The project models the problem as a constrained optimization task and applies heuristic strategies to maximize delivered aid value while minimizing logistical cost.
